Lecture 3 Assignment
   
**THEHOTEL.COM Demand Forecasting Assignment**
        
Consider a scenario where THEHOTEL.COM Finance team comes to you to build out a sales forecast at a hotel level using the provided CSV file. The available dataset contains information about the sales for each hotel for the first 13 weeks of each year. They would like to know what the forecast will look like in 2021 for the same period.
 Your task is twofold:
        1. Load, process, transform the data
        2. Develop a model that can be used to forecast at a Hotel level with the given information.
        3. Predict the next period
        
There are a few notes/restrictions to keep in mind as you build this:
        - Data provided has been randomized
        - Sales forecasts must be done for FY2021, Weeks 1 - 13

Provided dataset contains the following columns:
        - Week: The date where the review was done by Guests.
        - Hotel: A unique number assigned for each hotel.
        - 2016: Sales for 2016 for each hotel and each period of time listed in the week column
        - 2017: Sales for 2017 for each hotel and each period of time listed in the week column
        - 2018: Sales for 2018 for each hotel and each period of time listed in the week column
        - 2019: Sales for 2019 for each hotel and each period of time listed in the week column
        - 2020: Sales for 2020 for each hotel and each period of time listed in the week column
        
The challenge of the exercise is not to achieve the most efficient or sophisticated model from an algorithmic and/or coding perspective. However, we will pay particular attention to the following points: the overall organization of the workflow, preprocessing/features engineering, methodology for estimating performance, and discussions/comments on the generalizability and limitations of the algorithm.
        
Please provide your notes, explanations, interpretation and insights within a pptx presentation by taking into consideration all the above.
